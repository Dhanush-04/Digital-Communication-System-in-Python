# Digital-Communication-System-in-Python

This project implements a communication system for audio signals using various techniques, including BPSK modulation, Hamming coding for error detection and correction, and Huffman coding for compression. The system aims to encode, transmit, and decode audio signals while maintaining robustness against noise.

Features:
BPSK Modulation: Implements Binary Phase Shift Keying modulation for encoding audio signals.
Hamming Coding: Provides error detection and correction using Hamming codes to enhance the reliability of the transmitted data.
Huffman Coding: Utilizes Huffman coding for compression, reducing the size of the encoded audio data.
Audio Reconstruction: Reconstructs the original audio signal after decoding.
